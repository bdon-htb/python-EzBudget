# python-EzBudget
My grade 12 culminating assignment. It is a fairly basic GUI application developed with python and tkinter that can display income and expenses data.

## Prerequisites
EzBudget uses the python library **matplotlib** to display pie graphs. If you do not have it installed already I recommend using pip in Windows cmd to install it. This should already come packaged with most python downloads so you simply need to open cmd and enter the command:

```
pip install matplotlib
```
