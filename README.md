# python-EzBudget
My grade 12 culminating assignment. It is a fairly basic GUI application developed with python and tkinter that can display income and expenses data.

## Prerequisites
EzBudget uses the library matplotlib to display pie graphs. If you do not have it installed already I recommend using pip to install it.

```
pip install matplotlib
```

### Notes: 
This project was designed for, and is likely only compatible with windows systems (specifically, windows 10).
